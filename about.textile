Transition Town Tufnell Park began in 2010, and is part of the rapidly growing Transition Town network, locally, nationally and globally.

The Transition Town movement is a positive response to the challenges of diminishing cheap oil, coupled with climate change and a fragile financial system.

The idea is to move away from everything in our lives depending fossil fuels and move towards a less polluted, more sustainable lifestyle.

It's also about re-finding a lost sense of community; we can't face these challenges ourselves, nor rely on others to so the work for us - we must get in to groups and work together.

Since 2010 we have helped set up a central steering group, projects, groups, events, a local farmers market and are working towards a more community sustainable and community orientated Tufnell Park.
