  <h3>
    26 May: Thursday at the Diner
  </h3>
  <p>I went down to the Community Diner at Whittington Park Community Centre  on Friday evening and talked to Sam from <a href="http://churchfarmardeley.co.uk/">Church Farm</a>. I am impressed and I have put an order in for next Thursday when they are doing their first drop off in the area.</p>
<p>I also spoke to Ian Jury who has recently taken over the Community Diner. I was really impressed with what he is doing, too. He&#8217;s going to be opening late on Thursdays to allow people to pick up their farm orders.</p>
<p>I am planning to go and pick up at around 7pm on Thursday (earlier if I can make it) and stay in the diner until it closes at around 8pm and if anyone else would like to come over and talk Transition, I will be there occupying an unofficial Transition Table.</p>
<p>See you there,</p>

  </h3>
  <p>14th May</p>
<p>Siggy comes round again.  We do more weeding, and move a couple of unexpected raspberry shoots from the middle of the row of onions. I am pleased to find there are rather more carrots shooting up than I had thought. We cannot decide which of the flowers on the courgettes are male, and which female, but hope the insects will do the pollinating. There are amazing numbers of poppies sprouting here there and everywhere, and the kale and the chard are flourishing, as is the psb. I have been having some regularly. We  harvest some more radishes, and inspect the salad bed. It is full of sprouting stuff, but what is it? We pick out some obvious weeds, but it is hard to tell the difference between young alkanet (which grew beside the salad bed before the Big Dig) and newly-sprouting pak choy.  We decide to give it the benefit of the doubt for now. The beans are still disappointing. In the course of the weeding, we come across the remains of the packet of runner bean seeds, which must have been watered a few times as it sat in the middle of the seed drills. Siggy decided to take it home and start the remaining runner bean seeds in his conservatory. He went home for the football with radishes and psb in his bag. In the evening I watered everything, and found a few drops of rain falling on me as I did it &#8211; but only a few drops.</p>
<p>16th May</p>
<p>Still v little rain. Some of the salad growths are now identifiable as different kinds of lettuce &#8211; must plant them out in more space soon. There will be room where the radishes are finishing, and where the parsnips have failed to come up. The chard and the kale will need thinning out and replanting soon, too.</p>
<p>Find that we have a book about bats, which says it is “against the law to possess a bat, live or dead”. Fortunately the dead bat has disappeared &#8211; presumably the cats or a fox know where it has gone, so I will not be prosecuted (I hope). Does finding a dead bat in your garden count as possession? Anyway the book makes clear that the dead bat was a pipistrelle.</p>

  <p>7th May (continued)<br />
Rose and Dylan came round in the afternoon, and we harvested the first radishes! They tasted amazing.  We also did some weeding, and found a surprising number of carrot shoots.</p>
<p>8th May some rain but not nearly enough.</p>
<p>9th May Siggy came round in the evening. He identified that some of the french beans have come up, and could tell the difference between bean shoots and convolvulus! He produced a jekyll fork and dug up some of the runner beans to see what was going on &#8211; showed me how they had germinated, but that some small pest had eaten them from inside. He was puzzled &#8211; you don&#8217;t usually get pests like that with a first sowing, and no beans have been sown there for 20 years to my knowledge! He sowed some more and did a bit of weeding, while I earthed up the spuds in both the tyres. They look very vigourous! We checked the tomatoes, and Siggy showed me which side shoots to pinch out. The first trusses are well on their way and the second lot seem ready to come into flower. Then Siggy did a big water &#8211; a good 30 minutes with the hose &#8211; and went home with some radishes and some leaves from the <span class="caps">PSB</span>, which is flourishing mightily.</p>
<p>I remember reading somewhere, &#8220;If you want to be happy for ever, get a garden&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you worked on the garden and would like some radishes, get in touch with me or Rose to arrange a visit to get some this Saturday &#8211; or just to see how it is getting on. But please not too many people at once, arrange a visit first.</p>
<p>10th May &#8211; I had radishes and parsley from the garden in my lunchtime salad. No rain though it kept threatening. Hand watered the sage in the Eastern corner, which is showing signs of drought.</p>
<p>12th May &#8211; found the corpse of a small bat in the garden this morning, presumably a pipistrelle! Amazed, I didn&#8217;t think we had them here. Wish it could have been a live one. Wonder how it died &#8211; was it the cats? And if so, how did they catch it?</p>
