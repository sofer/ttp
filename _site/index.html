  <p>1) <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BIG</span> <span class="caps">DIG</span><br />
3rd April 2011 (Dark moon, good for clearing space)</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Big Dig, planned by Transition Tufnell Park to transform my overgrown garden into a food-producing allotment.</p>
<p>They came&#8230; and they came&#8230;. and they came&#8230;. about twenty people all told, though not all at once. Their ages ranged from senior to pre-school, they brought tools and energy, and got stuck in with amazing enthusiasm, good will and spirit of co-operation.</p>
<p>Their energy turned up  lots of stuff &#8211; the predictable, like convolvulus and bramble roots, and bluebell bulbs &#8211; Spanish hybrids, unfortunately; various plastic objects, some recognizable; lots of clothes pegs, some reclaimable for use; some tea-lights, ditto; one 20th century teaspoon, ditto; a few frogs. There were also some surprises: one ornate 19th-Century hinge, much corroded; some bits of decorative pottery and tiles, probably Victorian; the base of an Anderson shelter, Circa W War 2&#8230;.  It reinforced my sense of the history of this house, which has been here over 100 years. We have lived in it for just over 20.</p>
<p>My role was to dispense soup and cake as required, and to make certain decisions. Cut down the old plum tree? No, no &#8230; oh all right, then, yes, given that its trunk was demonstrably rotten. It eventually came down with a crack that reconciled me to saying goodbye to it. But get rid of my revolving  circular  clothes dryer? No, no, a thousand times no.</p>
<p>Soil was dug, plants pruned back, seven bags filled with plant stuff for recycling, and  more with builders&rsquo; rubble, in amazing quantities. Jugs of Pimms and cups of tea were drunk, and much chat and community bonding went on. It was amazing! I was thrilled and the space was transformed.</p>
<p>My 3 semi-feral cats were a little put our when everyone had gone and they came back to inspect the work; but fefore long they were chasing each other all over it and rolling in the newly-dug soil with great glee.</p>
<p>2)<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BIG</span> <span class="caps">PLANT</span>    11th  April 2011 Waxing moon</p>
<p>Stage 2 of the allotment project, and I would not be there! I left it all in the capable hands of Siggy and Rose. When I came home I was amazed. Rows of beans of two different kinds, purple sprouting broccoli, seed drills with various veg from carrots to chard, a whole bed said to be sown with salad greens, plants for peppers and courgettes &#8211; it was and is amazing. All I have to do now is to keep watering and weeding &#8211; and devise a way to stop the cats from chasing each other all over the seed beds! Fortunately they like the new paths which were  laid with bricks on Saturday.</p>
<p>The whole process has attracted the interest of neighbours, and I hope that it will help to spread the word about the Transition movement and our objectives.</p>
<p>I was just about to start watering with the new hosepipe this evening when it rained, although not very heavily. Praying for rain, anybody?</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody who came and helped. I hope to keep this blog updated, with news of when the first green shoots appear and so on. Watch this space!</p>
<p>12th April 2011</p>
<p>The recycling people have just taken away another 5 bags of vegetable matter, left over from Saturday!  Anything dug up from now on should really go on my compost heap, but at the moment I can&rsquo;t get near it because of a huge bag of compost that Rose organised to be brought round from Yerbury. We shall be using that for mulching when the shoots start to show.</p>
<p>The plants look very happy for last night&rsquo;s shower, but no bean shoots showing yet.</p>
<p>13th April 2011</p>
<p>No more rain,  so I use the hosepipe for the first time. It is harder than it looks! Afraid I might have shot some of the seeds out of the ground with too strong a jet&#8230;. I can see what looks like a couple of parsnip heads showing above the soil, but not where the parsnips were planted.  Perhaps the cats&rsquo; antics have shifted some of the seeds. They have flattened a couple of the onion sets, but these plants are tough.</p>
<p>How do you stop a cat, or four, from rolling around on seed drills? Watering said drills does not deter them in the least!</p>
