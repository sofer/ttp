    Offer your support: join up
  </h3>
  <p>A group of Transition groups in North London, including Transition Tufnell Park, are putting an <a href="http://www.energyshare.com/">energyshare</a> funding application together and you can help us by <a href="http://www.energyshare.com/north-london-transition-energy/">signing up as a supporter</a>.</p>
<p>Our aim is to reduce our carbon footprint through local action.</p>
<p>We plan to do this by a number of measures, including improving the insulation of our homes, switching to more energy-efficient lighting and appliances and by installing renewable sources of energy.</p>
<p>We intend to collect and disseminate information that will help our neighbours do the same thing and we are initiating support groups to help spur us all into action.<br />
We also hope to initiate a loan fund to allow cash-poor households to invest in energy-saving measures, too.</p>
<p>We expect one of our first initiatives to be the development of an advice service to householders on how to buy and install <span class="caps">LED</span> lighting to replace existing halogen and incandescent bulbs.</p>
<p>We are particularly keen to address the issue of fuel poverty by offering a credit facility to householders who cannot afford the upfront cost of replacing their bulbs.<br />
We aim to fund the credit scheme through a variety of means, which might include group buying of <span class="caps">LED</span> bulbs, seeking funding from local authorities or the private sector and applying for energyshare funding.</p>
<p>We hope the initiative will eventually be self-funding as loans made for the purchase of bulbs eventually get repaid.</p>
<p>Our members are drawn from Transition Belsize, Transition Primrose Hill, Transition Kentish Town and Transition Tufnell Park. We expect more Transition groups to join up soon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.energyshare.com/north-london-transition-energy/">Please support us by joining the group</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

    The Big Lunch at the Garden!
  </h3>
  <p>Thursday 2nd June</p>
<p>Last night there were still 21 runner shoots, this morning there were only 18 &#8211; something had eaten the leaves of 3 of them, leaving bare stalks. Probably slugs. How to protect the remainder?</p>
<p>Friday 3rd June</p>
<p>Rose came round with Arthur, to prepare for the Green Fair on Sat. She brought some empty clear plastic bottles and ideas to make a kind of cloche to protect the sprouting runners. I make some and instal them, in hope.</p>
<p>Sunday 5th June</p>
<p>The Big Lunch! I have had only 2 replies, but about a dozen people come.  The chairs which Rose brought round the other day come in very useful. The bottle cloches have worked, and Sue brings some beans already started in her conservatory and  about 2 feet high. The weather is grey and chill for the first time for ages, and spits of rain start as we gather. But there is lots of good food, good conversation, and weeding and planting goes on apace. The psb is sprouting again, the courgettes are fruiting well, the tomatoes have now been staked and more onions, lettuce and radishes are planted, as well as some tulips, marigolds  and sunflowers for attracting insects and making the place look lovely. Siggy was particularly pleased with the tulip bulbs, genuine Dutch ones, high class!  The spuds are showing signs of being about to flower.</p>
<p>Rose says the Green Fair was a great success and there was lots of interest.</p>
<p>We eventually get driven indoors as the rain gets serious &#8211; just as Rose and Siggy finish watering! Since then there has been another inch or so of rain &#8211; no watering to be done tonight.</p>
<p>The gathering was fun, we should do it again.</p>

  <p>We are a group of volunteers involved in several different Transition Town neighbourhoods in North London.</p>

  <h3>
    Monday 30th May - Bank Holiday
  </h3>
  <p>The barbecue did not happen, but yesterday I invited the neighbours in for tea and we did some more weeding. I gave away some radishes and more psb leaves &#8211; the one that sprouted before is sprouting again but not ready to harvest yet. The courgettes are coming on a treat, and the first one will be ready to harvest tonight I think. I offered it to Siggy, he has kindly texted me that I can have it.</p>
<p>I did two hours of weeding, and to my delight found no less than 18 runner bean shoots coming up, once I had eliminated the weeds. Lots of poppies coming up too, I am leaving them. This morning I counted 21 shoots. Maybe they will be like the scotch pines on Boudicca&rsquo;s mound, which give you a different answer every time you count them. Siggy has got some more going in his greenhouse, wherever will we plant them?</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t started among the french beans yet. The five shoots that have been up for a while are doing fine but there may be more when I get the weeds out&#8230;.</p>
<p>How come the runners took so long? Was it last Thursday&rsquo;s rain that did the trick? Do they prefer it to tapwater through the hose?</p>
