    01 Jun: North London Energy Transition
  </h3>
  <p>We are a group of volunteers involved in several different Transition Town neighbourhoods in North London.</p>
<p>Our aim is to get every building in North London switched over to <span class="caps">LED</span> lighting (not very ambitious, then).</p>
<p>We plan to do this by developing an advice service to householders on how to buy and install <span class="caps">LED</span> lighting to replace existing halogen and incandescent bulbs.</p>
<p>We are particularly keen to address the issue of fuel poverty by offering a credit facility to householders who cannot afford the upfront cost of replacing their bulbs.</p>
<p>We aim to fund the credit scheme through a variety of means, which might include group buying of <span class="caps">LED</span> bulbs, seeking funding from local authorities or the private sector and applying for energyshare funding.</p>
<p>We hope the initiative will eventually be self-funding as loans made for the purchase of bulbs eventually get repaid.</p>
<p>Our members are drawn from Transition Belsize, Transition Primrose Hill, Transition Kentish Town and Transition Tufnell Park. We expect more Transition groups to join up soon.<br />
Please support us by <a href="http://www.energyshare.com/north-london-transition-energy/">joining our group</a>.</p>

    30 May: The Garden Allotment Blog
  </h3>
  <p>The barbecue did not happen, but yesterday I invited the neighbours in for tea and we did some more weeding. I gave away some radishes and more psb leaves &#8211; the one that sprouted before is sprouting again but not ready to harvest yet. The courgettes are coming on a treat, and the first one will be ready to harvest tonight I think. I offered it to Siggy, he has kindly texted me that I can have it.</p>
<p>I did two hours of weeding, and to my delight found no less than 18 runner bean shoots coming up, once I had eliminated the weeds. Lots of poppies coming up too, I am leaving them. This morning I counted 21 shoots. Maybe they will be like the scotch pines on Boudicca&rsquo;s mound, which give you a different answer every time you count them. Siggy has got some more going in his greenhouse, wherever will we plant them?</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t started among the french beans yet. The five shoots that have been up for a while are doing fine but there may be more when I get the weeds out&#8230;.</p>
<p>How come the runners took so long? Was it last Thursday&rsquo;s rain that did the trick? Do they prefer it to tapwater through the hose?</p>

  <p>Just as we were despairing of seeing any growth among the canes&#8230; and just as I went down to see how the garden was faring after today&amp;#x27;s very welcome rain&#8230; I found 7 beans sprouting!!! One or two of them look a bit manky, and about 5 of them seemed to be close to the same bean pole, but they were definitely runner beans and definitely up and heading for growth. So 3 cheers and cause for celebration!!</p>

  <p>14th May</p>
<p>Siggy comes round again.  We do more weeding, and move a couple of unexpected raspberry shoots from the middle of the row of onions. I am pleased to find there are rather more carrots shooting up than I had thought. We cannot decide which of the flowers on the courgettes are male, and which female, but hope the insects will do the pollinating. There are amazing numbers of poppies sprouting here there and everywhere, and the kale and the chard are flourishing, as is the psb. I have been having some regularly. We  harvest some more radishes, and inspect the salad bed. It is full of sprouting stuff, but what is it? We pick out some obvious weeds, but it is hard to tell the difference between young alkanet (which grew beside the salad bed before the Big Dig) and newly-sprouting pak choy.  We decide to give it the benefit of the doubt for now. The beans are still disappointing. In the course of the weeding, we come across the remains of the packet of runner bean seeds, which must have been watered a few times as it sat in the middle of the seed drills. Siggy decided to take it home and start the remaining runner bean seeds in his conservatory. He went home for the football with radishes and psb in his bag. In the evening I watered everything, and found a few drops of rain falling on me as I did it &#8211; but only a few drops.</p>
<p>16th May</p>
<p>Still v little rain. Some of the salad growths are now identifiable as different kinds of lettuce &#8211; must plant them out in more space soon. There will be room where the radishes are finishing, and where the parsnips have failed to come up. The chard and the kale will need thinning out and replanting soon, too.</p>
<p>Find that we have a book about bats, which says it is &ldquo;against the law to possess a bat, live or dead&rdquo;. Fortunately the dead bat has disappeared &#8211; presumably the cats or a fox know where it has gone, so I will not be prosecuted (I hope). Does finding a dead bat in your garden count as possession? Anyway the book makes clear that the dead bat was a pipistrelle.</p>
