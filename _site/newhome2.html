<p><strong>What is Transition?</strong><br />
Transition Tufnell Park (<span class="caps">TTP</span>) is part of the Transition Town network and is one of many Transition Towns all over the world, working together to create community, sustainability and a positive future.</p>
<p><strong>What happens then?</strong><br />
Based on the ideas of peak oil and the importance of community, the aim is to Transition away from fossil fuels, towards a more carbon-neutral, community led and creative future.<br />
This could be anything from being part of a community garden, looking into energy, getting creative, or just having a drink with neighbours.</p>
<p><strong>So who are we?</strong><br />
<span class="caps">TTP</span> is you, me, and us working together. <br />
So it is basically anyone at all who wants to get involved with community based ways of living whilst acknowledging our relationship with the world around us. All time is volunteered.</p>
<p><strong>Get involved?</strong><br />
For starters, why not have a look at some of our projects, groups or events, and keep up to date with community updates?</p>
<p>If you have an idea for an event, an old time hobby that you want to share or a project to start, we want to offer support and links to others with similar ideas.</p>
<p>We also want to connect up local activity so please let us know if there&#8217;s something local you want publicised, or of anything we haven&#8217;t linked with yet.</p>
<p>There are no set rules and that&#8217;s why every Transition Town is different &#8211; it is whatever we make it and the more people involved, the more we can do together.</p>
