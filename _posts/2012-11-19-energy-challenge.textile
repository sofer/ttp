*PASSIVHAUS at the Palmerston with Justin Bere*

The domestic sector accounts for approximately 30% of all energy use and more than 25% of CO2 emissions in the UK. It therefore has a critical role in combating climate change, achieving energy security and alleviating fuel poverty.  Old homes are replaced at a rate of less than 1% per annum and there is an urgent need both for energy efficient new building and for the sustainable retrofit of existing housing stock.
 
Compared to standard new build in the UK, a Passive House achieves a 75% reduction in space heating requirements and so can be realistically covered by renewables,  saving on energy bills, reducing CO2 emissions and preserving the planet&rsquo;s dwindling fossil fuels. Moreover, a Passive House can be kept cool when it is hot, is draught-free and evenly warm and provides good, clean air.
 
Justin Bere is one of the UK&rsquo;s leading "Passivhaus":http://www.passivhaus.org.uk/ practitioners, deeply committed to ecological and environmental design.  His practice, "Bere:architects":http://www.bere.co.uk/, has won many awards. It is notable for its dissemination of Passivhaus expertise to other architects and practitioners and for encouraging UK manufacturing.  Bere Architects has unparalleled expertise in low-cost Passivhaus building techniques.
 
Justin Bere will be talking about the Passivhaus concept. His talk will focus on the use of  Passivhaus design in the retrofit of existing homes and the perceived conflict between architectural and environmental conservation.

7.30pm, Monday 19th November. 

Upstairs at the Lord Palmerston,
