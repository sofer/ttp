<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">What is a Transition Town?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">Here's how it all appears to be evolving... </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">It all starts off when a small collection of motivated individuals within a community come together with a shared concern: <em><strong><span style="font-family: Tunga;">how can our community respond to the challenges, and opportunities, of Peak Oil and Climate Change?</span></strong></em> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">They begin by forming an initiating group and then adopt the Transition Model with the intention of engaging a significant proportion of the people in their community to kick off a Transition Initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">A Transition Initiative is a community working together to look Peak Oil and Climate Change squarely in the eye and address this BIG question: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">"for all those aspects of life that this community needs in order to sustain itself and thrive, how do we significantly increase resilience (to mitigate the effects of Peak Oil) and drastically reduce carbon emissions (to mitigate the effects of Climate Change)?" </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">After going through a comprehensive and creative process of: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-top: 0cm;">
<li style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">awareness      raising around peak oil, climate change and the need to undertake a      community lead process to rebuild resilience and reduce carbon </span></li>
<li style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">connecting      with existing groups in the community </span></li>
<li style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">building      bridges to local government </span></li>
<li style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">connecting      with other transition initiatives </span></li>
<li style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">forming      groups to look at all the key areas of life (food, energy, transport,      health, heart &amp; soul, economics &amp; livelihoods, etc) </span></li>
<li style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">kicking off      projects aimed at building people's understanding of resilience and carbon      issues and community engagement </span></li>
<li style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">eventually      launching a community defined, community implemented "Energy Descent      Action Plan" over a 15 to 20 year timescale </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">This results in a coordinated range of projects across all these areas of life that strives to rebuild the resilience we've lost as a result of cheap oil and reduce the community's carbon emissions drastically. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">The community also recognises two crucial points: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-top: 0cm;">
<li style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">that we used      immense amounts of creativity, ingenuity and adaptability on the way up      the energy upslope, and </span></li>
<li style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">that there's      no reason for us not to do the same on the down-slope</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">if we collectively plan and act early enough there's every likelihood that we can create a way of living that's significantly more connected, more vibrant and more in touch with our environment than the oil-addicted treadmill that we find ourselves on today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a name="Disclaimer"></a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">Final point</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">Just to weave the climate change and peak oil situations together... </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">Climate change makes this carbon reduction transition essential </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">Peak oil makes it inevitable </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">Transition initiatives make it feasible, viable and attractive (as far we can tell so far...)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">(Personal Note from Cllr Graves) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">It&rsquo;s also about taking the politics out of the green agenda because it&rsquo;s more, much more, important than that. It&rsquo;s not about what each of the various political parties are doing to attract your vote by looking to care about green issues, it&rsquo;s about us all taking responsibility for the way we live and finding a more sustainable, more community responsible manner, in which to live our lives. Because when Peak Oil hits (and it&rsquo;s not far off) the world will change dramatically and it&rsquo;s better that we be ready for that change, than just hoping someone (government) will do everything for us when the time comes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tunga; color: #222222;">It&rsquo;s also about having fun whilst getting to that more sustainable point. The green agenda has, up till recent, been mostly about a kind of haranguing / puritanical, message. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. It can be fun and encouraging to change the way we live and this approach will, in turn, help to recreate local, mostly self sustainable, communities; which can only be a good thing.</span></p>
