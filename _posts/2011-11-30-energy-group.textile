Thanks to everyone for joining us for the inaugural meeting of the TTP energy group earlier this month. And special thanks to Louise for hosting.

We are next meeting at Penny's house at 6.30pm on Wednesday 30th November where we will be draught proofing Penny's kitchen window and sharing some food.
