The Economics of Happiness describes a world moving simultaneously in two opposing directions. On the one hand, an unholy alliance of governments and big business continues to promote globalization and the consolidation of corporate power.

Communities are coming together to re-build more human scale, ecological economies based on a new paradigm &ndash; an economics of localization.
