DO YOU LIVE IN OR AROUND TUFNELL PARK?

cycling in London is scary, cars are too many and pollution is filthy

LETS GET ON OUR BIKES!

Join the TUFNELL PARK BIKE BLOCK, Thursday 6th October.

Assemble between 5 and 5.30 outside Tufnell Park playing fields, Campdale Road side.

Promoting bicycles, meeting neighbours and cycling safely around the community together we will Bike Block until 6pm where we will reconvene at the Tufnell Park tavern

Bring - your bike and a helmet, all ages welcome!

ONE MORE BIKE MEANS ONE LESS CAR
