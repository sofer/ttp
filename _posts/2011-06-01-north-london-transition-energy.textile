summary: "A new joint initiative of Transition groups in North London" 
---
We are a group of volunteers involved in several different Transition Town neighbourhoods in North London.

Our aim is to get every building in North London switched over to LED lighting (not very ambitious, then).

We plan to do this by developing an advice service to householders on how to buy and install LED lighting to replace existing halogen and incandescent bulbs.

We are particularly keen to address the issue of fuel poverty by offering a credit facility to householders who cannot afford the upfront cost of replacing their bulbs.

We aim to fund the credit scheme through a variety of means, which might include group buying of LED bulbs, seeking funding from local authorities or the private sector and applying for energyshare funding.

We hope the initiative will eventually be self-funding as loans made for the purchase of bulbs eventually get repaid.

Our members are drawn from Transition Belsize, Transition Primrose Hill, Transition Kentish Town and Transition Tufnell Park. We expect more Transition groups to join up soon.
