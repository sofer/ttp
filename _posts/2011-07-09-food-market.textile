The Tufnell Park Tavern and Transition Town Tufnell Park have been working together to bring a food market to the area. The market will have a range of goods including meat, bread, eggs, cakes, pies, fruit, veg, organic produce, local honey, ice cream and more.

The project is new and needs your support to be sustainable. Spend your money locally.
