'What might an economy based on free exchange, not competition and coercion, be like, feel like?' 

The Free shop at the market outside the Tufnell Park Tavern was a big success, thanks to all who donated items, and came along on the day.

Let us know if you'd like to know about more events like this in the future, and if you'd like to help in organising similar events.

The more people to help at these events the more events there will be - we're waiting for you!
