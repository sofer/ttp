summary: "Damian Lewis joins Families at Tufnell Park Cycles to School Photo Shoot"
---
Golden Globe winner Damian Lewis joined parents and children to show support for Tufnell Park Cycles to School, the campaign for a local network of safe routes to school. The Islington Gazette photographed the gathering to support an article in this week's newspaper highlighting the campaign. 

Many children would prefer to cycle to school but are intimidated by fast moving vehicles. The local council is responsible for public health, education and streets and so our councillors have the power to give children the freedom to cycle to school. We want the candidates in the St. George's & Junction Ward by-elections to commit themselves to this cycling & walking initiative.
