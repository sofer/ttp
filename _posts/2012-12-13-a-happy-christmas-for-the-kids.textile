Yerbury Home School Association would like to thank all the Farmers Market stalls, shops in Campdale Rd, Ruby Violet & Violet & Fredrick flowers for their generous donations to the hamper which was raffled at Yerbury Schoolâ€™s Christmas Cracker fair on Friday. The money raised will be used to develop the playground facilities. Thanks very much!
