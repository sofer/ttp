summary: "Come down to the Community Diner at Whittington Park Community Centre on Thursday evening"

I went down to the Community Diner at Whittington Park Community Centre  this evening and talked to Sam from "Church Farm":http://churchfarmardeley.co.uk/. I am impressed and I have put an order in for next Thursday when they are doing their first drop off in the area.

I also spoke to Ian Jury who has recently taken over the Community Diner. I was really impressed with what he is doing, too. He's going to be opening late on Thursdays to allow people to pick up their farm orders.

I am planning to go and pick up at around 7pm on Thursday (earlier if I can make it) and stay in the diner until it closes at around 8pm and if anyone else would like to come over and talk Transition, I will be there occupying an unofficial Transition Table.

See you there,
