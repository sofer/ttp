The secret garden was started by local people and is for local people.

It is found in a wonderful woman's back garden on Huddleston Road and increasingly the front garden too!

You can get involved on regular Sundays and learn to grow your own food and much more!

There garden uses permaculture principles and there are vegetables growing, fruit trees, frogs in the pond, a wild life area, water collection, compost and more.

There is also often tea and cakes.

Children welcome.

If you would like this secret garden group to advise you on how to set up your own community garden please get in touch.
