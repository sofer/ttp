summary: "an initiative of Transition Kentish Town and Transition Tufnell Park &ndash; bringing contemporary art to Kentish Town via The UnShop" 
---
Happy are those who see beauty in modest spots where others see nothing. Everything is beautiful; the whole secret lies in knowing how to interpret it Camille Pissarro (1893) quoted in Gillian Tindall&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Fields Beneath The history of One London Village [Kentish Town]&rdquo;

Transition Kentish Town and Transition Tufnell Park have brought together 7 artists to explore this field, working on the idea of the hidden images and hidden beauty which can emerge from a background of the mundane things which might otherwise be overlooked. Through a range of media the artists interpret this secret beauty, and develop ideas of visual ambiguity and aesthetics, bringing forth unexpected form for &ldquo;those who see where others see nothing&rdquo;.

The works will be on display in the UnShop pop-up, formerly a pound shop and now a space dedicated to non-commercial means of enriching the life of the inhabitants of Kentish Town and those who come to visit it.

The Artists: Jerome Beresford, Corrina Eastwood, Danny Pockets, Jennifer Roberts, Liz Sheridan, Steve Smith, Michi Suzuki.

About the curator: Liz Sheridan has recently returned from curating a fringe event at the Venice Art Biennale (see www.invasivealienspecies.wordpress.com) and works closely with East London-based TangentProjects (www.tangentprojects.org)
