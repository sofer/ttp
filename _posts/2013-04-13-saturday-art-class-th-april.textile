In addition to our free weekday art classes we are running bi monthly 2 hour Saturday classes. This Saturday's class is for 7-14 year olds from 2-4pm. 

They will be creating paper flowers as well as other paper crafts.

As it is a 2 hour class and on a weekend there is a suggested donation of Â£3 to cover art materials to help the project continue to run.
