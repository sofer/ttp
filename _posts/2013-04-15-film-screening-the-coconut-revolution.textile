Come join us upstairs at the Palmerston to see a multi-award winning documentary about the struggle of the indigenous peoples of Bougainville Island - dubbed the "world's first successful eco-revolution". It's less than an hour long so we'll carry on afterwards with drinks and discussion to enjoy the newly refurbished Lord P!

This event has been organised jointly with the North London Energy Transition.
