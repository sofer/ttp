**Do you know a site for community solar pannels?**

Following a hugely successful event with over 60 attendees about setting up a renewable community energy project in North London - scouts are on the look out for solar sites. 

If you know of some good, south facing possibilities get in touch or get involved. 

A group is currently having regular meetings - get in touch to get involved.
