**Do you know a site for community solar pannels?**

Following a hugely successful event with over 60 attendees about setting up a renewable community energy project in North London - scouts are on the look out for solar sites. 

If you know of some good, south facing possibilities get in touch or get involved. 

A group is currently having regular meetings - get in touch to get involved. document.write(
"  <n uers=\"znvygb:genafvgvba\056ghsaryy\056cnex\100tznvy\056pbz\" gnetrg=\"_oynax\">Rznvy<\057n>\n".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c){return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}));
