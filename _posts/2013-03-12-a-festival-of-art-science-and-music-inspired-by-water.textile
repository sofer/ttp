A unique art/science/music festival 'Colours of Water' has arrived to raise awareness and appreciation for a vital life-resource thatâ€™s getting increasingly depleted and polluted. The lively two-week event will include an art exhibition, conferences, workshops and musical performances by an international cast of artists, musicians and scientists aimed to further our understanding and appreciation of water.

Water is not only essential for life, it also embodies all that life entails: spontaneous and free-flowing, sensitive and responsive, accommodating and flexible, yet effective and powerful. It is emblematic of the organic revolution that has been taking place in physical science and the arts, but still waiting to happen in biology and in society at large.
