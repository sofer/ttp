summary: "Help Londonâ€™s house sparrows and take part in the RSPB Cockney Sparrow Count 18 June to 12 July!" 
---
The Cockney sparrow was once a regular fixture in our London gardens, parks and squares. However, the city lost 68% of them between 1994 and 2000. The RSPB are asking Londoners to spend an hour, sometime between 18 June and 12 July, looking for house sparrows in their gardens and/or local green spaces and parks. It will help identify where populations are doing well, just clinging on or faring badly.

The survey can be done anywhere in Greater London and the more people that get involved, the better the information will be! The information you give them will help inform their conservation efforts to save this iconic London bird.

For further information and access to the survey site visit www.rspb.org.uk/sparrowcount or email "CSC@rspb.org.uk":mailto:CSC@rspb.org.uk.

The project is being run in partnership with the London Wildlife Trust and Greenspace information for Greater London (GiGL) as part of the London Biodiversity Partnership.
