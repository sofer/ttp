Three local Transition Towns &ndash; Kentish Town, Dartmouth Park and Tufnell Park &ndash; are meeting to set up an &lsquo;energy efficiency challenge&rsquo;, with representatives from the three, metering their energy use, and reporting back.

Energy and IT consultant, Paul Tanner, is giving a talk on his experiences of the metering challenge, followed by local "_economical environmentalist_":http://www.economicalenvironmentalist.co.uk/, Prashant Vaze.
