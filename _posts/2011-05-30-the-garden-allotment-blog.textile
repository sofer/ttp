The barbecue did not happen, but yesterday I invited the neighbours in for tea and we did some more weeding. I gave away some radishes and more psb leaves - the one that sprouted before is sprouting again but not ready to harvest yet. The courgettes are coming on a treat, and the first one will be ready to harvest tonight I think. I offered it to Siggy, he has kindly texted me that I can have it.

I did two hours of weeding, and to my delight found no less than 18 runner bean shoots coming up, once I had eliminated the weeds. Lots of poppies coming up too, I am leaving them. This morning I counted 21 shoots. Maybe they will be like the scotch pines on Boudicca&rsquo;s mound, which give you a different answer every time you count them. Siggy has got some more going in his greenhouse, wherever will we plant them?

Haven&rsquo;t started among the french beans yet. The five shoots that have been up for a while are doing fine but there may be more when I get the weeds out....

How come the runners took so long? Was it last Thursday&rsquo;s rain that did the trick? Do they prefer it to tapwater through the hose?
