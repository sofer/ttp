As part of their Spring Film Season, Transition Kentish Town are showing _Farm for the Future_ at Annie's Bar on Kentish Town High Street. 

It's a very likeable short documentary about the potential impact of peak oil on farming and the narrator Rebecca's attempt to make her small family farm in Devon fit for the future.

Screening starts at 7pm.
