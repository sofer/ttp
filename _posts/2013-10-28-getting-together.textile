**Monday 28th, 8-9pm Hawthorn Schnapps Tufnell Park Social at the Literary Cafe, 142 Fortess Road**

Bring your own alcohol (vodka or brandy is good, or lemonade) and jars/bottles if you have, or don't worry if not as there will be some provided. You can take your own foraged hawthorn drink home at the end. The Literary cafe will be open and the event will be continued afterwards in the Junction pub.

This is a joint event with Transition Tufnell Park and Tufnell Park Meetup Group.

Contact transition.tufnell.park@gmail.com for more info.
(Please feel free to still bring you knitting this month)
