Are you interested in doing a Transition Network training in London one weekend ?

These are some of Transition Network's trainings for people who want to spend a weekend with others learning more about what's involved or deepening their understanding of how to build and energise their group; Launch, Thrive , Effective Groups and Inner Transition and info on each is here http://www.transitionnetwork.org/training/courses

Contact Anna O'Brien at Transition Hackney at aob3ataol.com asap if you'd like to be added to the current waiting lists for any of the trainings and once there are enough people for each, a date will be fixed for the next one. Everyone who's already been in touch with me is still on the lists.
