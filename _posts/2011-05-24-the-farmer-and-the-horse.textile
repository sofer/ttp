summary: "part of Transition Kentish Town's film season"

As part of their Spring Film Season, Transition Kentish Town are showing _The Farmer and the Horse_ at Annie's Bar. 

It's a fascinating immersion into the world of three young people trying to get into agriculture who have fallen in love with working with horses. A vision of how farming might be in a lower-energy world.

All film showings are in the downstairs room at Annie's Bar, 180 Kentish Town Road, NW5 2AE.

These are relaxed occasions and they usually have a friendly discussion afterwards. A &pound;2 donation is requested.
