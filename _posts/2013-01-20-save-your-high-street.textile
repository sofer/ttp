What?
We are lucky to have a number of interesting and independent cafes in the area, now threatened by the arrival of Costa. If you value diversity and the reciprocity of truly local businesses, now is the time to show your support for our neighbourhood cafes.
When?
Everyday!
Where?
Fortess Road in particular
