<div style="font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wouldn't it be great to have a Famer's market in Tufnell Park?!</span><br />&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div style="font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We are working with the Tufnell Park Tavern to get a<strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> farmers market</span></strong> up and running outside the Tufnell Park Tavern, on Tufnell Park Road.</div>
<div style="font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The managers of Tufnell Park Tavern have been trying to get a weekly Market up and running for some months, but the market organisers, 'London Farmer's Markets' are reluctant as they are not convinced there would be enough trade and that it might take away trade from the existing FM at Parliament Hill. We feel strongly that this is not the case and are supporting the tavern by compiling a&nbsp;<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span class="il">petition</span></span></span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span>of local people who would definitely shop at a FM were there to be one outside the pub. <br />We are aiming to collect 500 names and would greatly appreciate your support in getting these signatures from local residents. <br />Here is a link to the petition.<p />You can help by:<br />3) Printing out a copy, getting a page of signatures and handing your completed page in to the TP tavern<br />2) Spreading the word!&nbsp;</div>
