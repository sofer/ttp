summary: "part of Transition Kentish Town's film season" 
---
As part of their Spring Film Season, Transition Kentish Town are showing _The Economics of Happiness_ at Annie&#x27;s Bar. 

A powerful new film about how &lsquo;going local&rsquo; is a powerful strategy to repair our fractured world: our ecosystems, our societies and our selves.

All film showings are in the downstairs room at Annie&#x27;s Bar, 180 Kentish Town Road, NW5 2AE.

These are relaxed occasions and they usually have a friendly discussion afterwards. A &pound;2 donation is requested.
