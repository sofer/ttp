---

Tuesday 12th June - 6.30pm
As a group, we will explore some green spaces in Tufnell Park, learn about what is growing all around us and forage some fine treats from natures treasures.

Meet at the small children's playground in the corner of Tufnell Park Playing fields at 6.30.

We will leave from the meeting point at 7pm, but will have an introduction at 6.30pm, so please do try to be on time.

All ages and experiences welcome!
