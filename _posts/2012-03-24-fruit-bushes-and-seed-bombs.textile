Start making your garden or terrace into a productive space - buy a fruit bush! 

You don't need a large space, a bush in a pot will be happy on any patio which gets the sun. We'll have Gooseberries, Blackcurrants, Tayberries, Redcurrants and Raspberries, ready for planting. All just Â£3 each! 

Plus - for the guerrilla gardener in all of us, make a wild flower seed bomb and brighten up those unloved or unreachable places in your neighbourhood! Wild flowers attract bees, butterflies and many other pollinating insects as well as adding colour and cheer to our neighbourhood! All materials free of charge!
