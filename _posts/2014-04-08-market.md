The market was set up by local residents, The Tufnell Park Tavern and Transition Tufnell Park.

Shopping at it helps to reduce food miles, encourage sustainable farming, local exchange. The market also helps people to get to know their neighbours and generally brings people together.

If you want to sign up to get a regular space at the market please contact Kate:

Transition Tufnell Park also have a free space available at the market for anyone who wants to do a one off stall on something that is community or environmentally related.

For example in the past we have used it to make bicycle powered smoothies, raffle vegetables from the garden, do seed sewing or put on a swap shop.

For more info one having a one off stall, please contact us.
