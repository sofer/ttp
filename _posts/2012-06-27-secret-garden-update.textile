Early last spring, Transition Tufnell Park was given the opportunity by Penny Cloutte to transform her garden from a wilderness to a flourishing group garden. Working together, the plot which was full of brambles, weeds and debris has become, over the year a productive, communal, fruit and vegetable garden. The group meet monthly with a more frequent watering and weeding rota in summer. The garden is unbelievably productive with plenty for all to share; chard, onions, potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, beans and more. In November we added fruit trees and this spring, a herb garden and pond.

Part of the garden's success has been the friendship and camaraderie which has built up around the activity. There is always lashings of tea and cake when we meet, friendship to grow as well as the vegetables and we have great fun.
