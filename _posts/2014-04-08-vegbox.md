The vegbox was launched by Transition Kentish Town as a spin off from their food group.

It uses fresh seasonal produce weekly from farms as close to London as practicable, and members pick up their weekly veg every Wednesday from one of several pick up points round Kentish Town and Tufnell Park.

You can currently pick up from Ruby Violets, the homemade ice cream shop on Fortess Road.

If you know of anywhere else that could be a pick up point in Tufnell Park please let us know.
