summary: "Stop press: the runner beans are up!" 
---
Just as we were despairing of seeing any growth among the canes... and just as I went down to see how the garden was faring after today&#x27;s very welcome rain... I found 7 beans sprouting!!! One or two of them look a bit manky, and about 5 of them seemed to be close to the same bean pole, but they were definitely runner beans and definitely up and heading for growth. So 3 cheers and cause for celebration!!
