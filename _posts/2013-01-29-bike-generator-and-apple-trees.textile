summary: "The story of the local council funding"
---
Over the last year, Transition Tufnell Park have generously been awarded some local council funding.

Part of this was used to buy 2 apple trees which were planted in the Tufnell Park Playing Fields.
We also bought a bicycle trailer for events which can be used by anyone in the Transition TP group.

Lastly, we made an amazing bicycle powered generator.

This is a sound system that works through pedal power - an amazing invention.

It will be brought out at events coming up soon.

Both the trailer and the bike generator are for the use of the community and we encourage that people ask to borrow them for local events.
