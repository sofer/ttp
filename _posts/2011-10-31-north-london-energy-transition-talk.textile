Transition Tufnell Park, along with several other Transition Town neighbourhoods, have formed a North London Energy Transition Group. It will be focused on reducing our carbon footprint through local action on energy issues.

Transition Kentish Town will be hosting a talk from Richard Griffiths who works for Parity Projects, who are experts in low-energy retrofit of homes. He is also a member of the UK Green Building Council.

He will be discussing the forthcoming Green Deal, which could provide opportunities for homeowners and residents to save energy and reduce their carbon at very little or no cost.

Time: 7pm-8:30pm, Monday 31st October

Venue: The Grand Union, 79 Highgate Road, Kentish Town, NW5 1TL
