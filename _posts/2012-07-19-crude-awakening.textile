_Crude Awakening: The Oil Crash_, produced and directed by award-winning European journalists and filmmakers Basil Gelpke and Ray McCormack, tells the story of how our civilization&rsquo;s addiction to oil puts it on a collision course with geology. Compelling, intelligent, and highly entertaining, the film visits with the world&rsquo;s top experts and comes to a startling, but logical conclusion &ndash; our industrial society, built on cheap and readily available oil, must be completely re-imagined and overhauled.

Come and join us upstairs at the Lord Palmerston to see this inspiring film.
