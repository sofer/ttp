summary: "Justin Bere on Passivhaus"
---
Justin Bere, one of the UK&rsquo;s foremost Passivhaus practitioners, will be talking at Corks &amp; Forks, followed by a North London Energy Challenge catch-up. Justin is a leader in the adoption of the Passivhaus standard in the UK. His practice, bere:architects, completed London&rsquo;s first Passivhaus and jointly England&rsquo;s first certified Passivhaus in 2010. This house, in Camden, shows how easily a Passivhaus home can exceed the UK&rsquo;s 2016 zero carbon compliance target without even needing any photovoltaic panels. The practice also completed the UK&rsquo;s first non-domestic full Passivhaus retrofit project which was certified in 2011, and is working on numerous other domestic and non-domestic new build and retrofit Passivhaus projects.
