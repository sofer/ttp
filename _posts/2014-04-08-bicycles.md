This sound system (MK1) was built from scratch through Transition Tufnell Park with funding from the local council.

Mk1 can be used at events to play music, for educational purposes to teach about renewable energy, or to help generate power.

MK1 can be charged through mains elecricity or it can be powered by the bicycle itself. The whole trailer is also mobile.

MK1 is a community resource so please get in touch if you want to use it, or find out more information.
