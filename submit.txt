18/02/2013 13:32:36	PASSIVHAUS	Justin Bere on Passivhaus	Justin Bere, one of the UKâ€™s foremost Passivhaus practitioners, will be talking at Corks & Forks, followed by a North London Energy Challenge catch-up. Justin is a leader in the adoption of the Passivhaus standard in the UK. His practice, bere:architects, completed London's first Passivhaus and jointly England's first certified Passivhaus in 2010. This house, in Camden, shows how easily a Passivhaus home can exceed the UK's 2016 zero carbon compliance target without even needing any photovoltaic panels. The practice also completed the UK's first non-domestic full Passivhaus retrofit project which was certified in 2011, and is working on numerous other domestic and non-domestic new build and retrofit Passivhaus projects.
