There are many ways, big and small to get involved with Transition Tufnell Park.

Firstly, make your you're signed up to our monthly newsletter to keep up to date (link)

Come along to our events, such as film screenings, green drinks, knitting and sowing.

Get involved in a project such as the secret garden community growing project, draught busting or the free shop.

Or you could suggest other ideas and email us if you'd like some support to make it happen.

We're always looking for volunteers to help us with our various projects, groups and events so whether you've got people skills, design skills, enough time to print one flyer or to plant some potatoes, there's something for everyone.
